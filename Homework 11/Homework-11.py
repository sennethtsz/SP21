In the videos, we saw the "diet problem". (The diet problem is one of the first large-scale optimization problems to be
studied in practice. Back in the 1930's and 40's, the Army wanted to meet the nutritional requirements of its soldiers
while minimizing the cost.) In this homework you get to solve a diet problem with real data. The data is given in the
file diet.xls.

1.	Formulate an optimization model (a linear program) to find the cheapest diet that satisfies the maximum and minimum
daily nutrition constraints, and solve it using PuLP.  Turn in your code and the solution. (The optimal solution should
be a diet of air-popped popcorn, poached eggs, oranges, raw iceberg lettuce, raw celery, and frozen broccoli. UGH!)

2.	Please add to your model the following constraints (which might require adding more variables) and solve the new

a.	If a food is selected, then a minimum of 1/10 serving must be chosen. (Hint: now you will need two variables for 
each food i: whether it is chosen, and how much is part of the diet. You'll also need to write a constraint to link 
them.)
